title: Georgia Election Runoffs / Volunteering
---

This past week, I spent about 3-4 hours volunteering as part of the Jon Ossoff campaign. There's two electionsh happening to elect both Georgia's senators which will ultimately determine who controls the legislative chamber; it has pretty important implications for Biden's first term.

So I wanted to start this off by talking about how I feel volunteering for political campaigns; it's hard for me to not feel that I'm providing free labor to enrich the candidate. When they win, that person will establish their career, job, and financial gains and take far more than I will. Now of course, while they will benefit _most_ individually, there is the hope that collectively, the benefits for the rest will far outweigh what they gain, and that's why people volunteer. It just feels gross, and yet I still volunteer because not participating is worse (although I think someone taking the stance of deliberating not volunteering because it's a bad system is _far_ better than someone who just doesn't have the time / not wanting to give their time). Plus, volunteering is fun and I feel happier knowing I did it. In addition to this, I donated a $1000. There's two friends to thank for this, Kenneth R and Sonya Z, and I really do appreciate their contributions and push.

I guess the above shows that there can be contradictions between how you feel and what you intellectually believe, and that also for some beliefs, it's better to overlook them sometimes. I do hope they dramatically reform the system, by "removing money" in politics and also lowering the prestige and benefits politicians receive from their role. That or pay people instead of relying on free labor; we don't allow companies to do the same but campaigns can do what they want.

Now to describe what volunteering looks like. In the first session we used a system called ThruTalk which contains many different voter lists. The system then dials a number, connects you to them so that they can say your piece, record information (like vote, wrong number, do not call) and so forth, and then onto the next. Over the course of a hour, I probably spoke to about 5-6 people, a few who cheered me for volunteering and said they've already voted, and a couple others who were not thrilled to be receiving the call. One women also spoke for about a minute regarding that she's already voted and received far too many calls and texts, and it's not a good look for the democratic party (fwiw, I agree with here and wish the "do not call" was more effective). I didn't speak to a single undecided voter, or even one who I was able to share valuable information on. It's hard to not be discouraged. The saving grace is knowing that this election is close (it's why we're having runoffs!) and the victory will be won in the margins, and phone banks do show 1-2% improvements (their statistic, unverified). There was about 60 volunteers in my session, with most likely in the 50+ age range.

The second session was done through the campaign's AAPI arm; there was 6 of present and more in my age range. This is probably the goto in getting new volunteers to join. Here we're given a spreadsheet of about 200 names and the task is to message all of them. The thinking is the AAPI group are active WhatsApp users so would be effective. Again of the all of messages sent, only a handful responded, and nobody asked for more information. I did share possibly looking into using Twillio SMS to programtically message the list, but was told it's likely a rule that humans need to behind the "send" button. Here's two screenshots.

I have volunteered before on the Obama campaign, and while I did think that was also pretty ineffective use of my time, being in person made a difference. There's shared dinner / pizza and shared feelings and excitment doing it.

Hoping for the best. I know my experience likely won't move the needle but collectively we might make the differnce. The stakes are high and I'm glad to have taken part.
